A picture within a picture within picture



This is the polygon fill branch. It's nice that the other branch works, but we may want to have the ability to draw a quadrilateral instead of have it always be a rectangle. That'd be nice because there's a lot of pictures like Sam's profile picture that have pictures in the background that aren't perfectly square.

Specs: Click on the canvas, and it'll draw a point there. Four points and it'll highlight a polygon.
Maybe when you click the fourth time, you lose the option to click, it highlights the shape for you, and two buttons appear: try again, and select repeating section. Try again allows you to make a new polygon,   select repeating section picks the rectangle that you want to copy paste, and when you do that, you can click transform. You could also press go-back, to select the rectangle again.
